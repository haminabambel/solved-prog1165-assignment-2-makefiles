For the second assignment you will develop a simple program that requires a makefile.

The program is a number guessing game where the user is asked to enter an integer number within a range, and the program will tell the user if it is too high, too low, or the correct guess.

<em><u>Minimum Requirements</u></em>

<ol>

 <li>The program is a console program and may be written in C or C++.</li>

 <li>All related functions should be in separate source files.</li>

 <li>Game functions:

  <ol>

   <li>Create random number</li>

   <li>Determine if guess is too high (return 1), too low (return -1) or correct (return 0)</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>User interface functions:

  <ol>

   <li>Ask the user for a guess and validate it is an integer</li>

   <li>Tell the user the result of the guess</li>

  </ol></li>

 <li>No global variables are permitted</li>

 <li>The upper limit of the guessing range must be specified by a #define statement</li>

 <li>Use a makefile early in the process but you must use macros extensively.</li>

 <li>Create a second makefile with appropriate macro definitions to compile the solution on a Linux system (Ubuntu preferred).</li>

</ol>




Please submit your completed assignment to the D2L dropbox in a zipped folder. Include only the source files and the 2 makefiles.

Note: Do not submit a Visual Studio solution. The purpose of this exercise is explicitly to avoid the use of Visual Studio.
